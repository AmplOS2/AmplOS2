# Another Port System
For anOS to become a seriously viable operating system, it, of course, has to
have some kind of way to get Third Party software. `aport` will solve this
problem by being a (reasonably) cross-platform, (reasonably)
\*BSD-Ports/MacPorts-like environment for achieving this. It also implements
ideas similar to those put forward by the distri Linux distribution/package
manager.
