another operating system

even on ubuntu you need to download your own cross-compiler, wow arm, wow canonical:
```
https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-a/10.2-2020.11/binrel/gcc-arm-10.2-2020.11-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf.tar.xz?revision=79f65c42-1a1b-43f2-acb7-a795c8427085&la=en&hash=3BEE623628664E6E1736ABBE7CE5AD76B65B51EA
```

this is currently only designed to run on raspi3/4 (when the 5 comes out we will support it fairly quickly). x86/â€¦ support is "planned" (writing the boot code for raspis was already tricky enough).
