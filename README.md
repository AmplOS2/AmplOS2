another operating system

even on ubuntu you need to download your own cross-compiler, wow arm, wow canonical:
```
https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-a/9.2-2019.12/binrel/gcc-arm-9.2-2019.12-x86_64-aarch64-none-elf.tar.xz?revision=ea238776-c7c7-43be-ba0d-40d7f594af1f&la=en&hash=2937ED76D3E6B85BA511BCBD46AE121DBA5268F3
```

this is currently only designed to run on raspi3/4 (when the 5 comes out we will support it fairly quickly). x86/â€¦ support is "planned" (writing the boot code for raspis was already tricky enough).
